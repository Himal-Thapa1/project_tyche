# Project Tyche

This project was created as a personal challenge to test whether I could build a similar-looking application under one night using Flutter.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is purely experimental and for learning purposes. It was and still not intended for production use or as a fully-featured application. Instead, it served as a way for me to explore Flutter's capabilities and to challenge myself to create something within a limited timeframe.

## Features

- The application consists of a spinning wheel with various items.
- Users can tap on the "SPIN" button to spin the wheel and see which item it lands on.
- A sound effect plays when the spinning animation completes.
- A popup dialog displays the result of the spin, indicating whether the user has won an item or not.

## Development Environment

- This project was developed using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
- Flutter allows for rapid development and deployment of applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Installation

To run this project locally, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and use the following command to run the application:

```bash
flutter run
